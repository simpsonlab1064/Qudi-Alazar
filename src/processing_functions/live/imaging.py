"""
This file contains a template for live-processing functions.

Live functions _must_ conform to the function signature in this file and they
must be in a file that has the same name as the function being called (e.g.
template() is called from template.py).

You are welcome to put additional / helper functions in this file or wherever
you would like (as long as you use full module paths to access them)

The arguments are as follows:

data: ProcessedData containing the previous data from the acquisition. Note that it
      will be empty on the first buffer as there is no data yet
buf: Array containing the most recently acquired buffer
settings: All of the experimental settings for your measurement (image w/h,
          number of frames, ...). Probably you should type hint the correct
          ExperimentSettings for what you're doing.
buffer_index: What buffer number are we on? (this increments once all boards have
                supplied one buffer, so it is equivalent to frame number if you
                are doing imaging)
board_index: Which board is this buffer from?
boards: List of boards in the system -- for determining measurement type / if
        a given channel is enabled

The return should be a ProcessedData. If you intend to do imaging, it should have
the shape [data_index][data] where [data] could be 1- or 2-dimensional and 
[data_index] indicates something of meaning to you about the images (board,
channel, polarization, some combination of those, ... )
